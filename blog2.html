                <h2>Contribution that do not constitute knoelage</h2> 
                <li>Emphasizing and attenuating, exaggerating or downplaying, adding and omitting, deforming and alienating, pictures make us aware of hitherto unnoticed features of objects thereby yielding a new way of conceiving of them</li>

               <h2>Art crosses all divides</h2>
               <li>Works of art, whether in physical or intangible form, can often easily be understood by people from different social, cultural, and political backgrounds. It’s one of the reasons why music is referred to as a musical language. Also, through observation of artifacts and artworks, as well as the messages encoded in literature, music, and poetry, it is possible to gain insight and understanding of other people’s history and present-day realities.</li>
               <h2>naturally artistic</h2>
               <li>The capacity for humans to naturally conceive up artistic creations, and how those artworks inspire and motivate us, continues to be the basis of various studies and discussions about the origin of music and other arts in general. It would seem our very DNA is coded to create and appreciate art. That can be the only logical explanation as to why toddlers draw on walls, play in their food, and react to music, even without having been taught those things</li>
               <h2>Art use</h2>
               <li>So many uses are their Art, in its broadest sense, is a form of communication. It means whatever the artist intends it to mean, and this meaning is shaped by the materials, techniques, and forms it makes use of, as well as the ideas and feelings it creates in its viewers . Art is an act of expressing feelings, thoughts, and observations.</li>
               <h2>About Aesthetics art </h2>
               <li>Aesthetics is the branch of philosophy that deals with the nature and appreciation of art, beauty, and taste. Aesthetics is central to any exploration of art. The word “aesthetic” is derived from the Greek “aisthetikos,” meaning “esthetic, sensitive, or sentient. ” In practice, aesthetic judgment refers to the sensory contemplation or appreciation of an object (not necessarily a work of art), while artistic judgment refers to the recognition, appreciation, or criticism of a work of art.</li>
