                <h2>About vaccination</h2>
                <li>Being vaccinated does not mean that we can throw caution to the wind and put ourselves and others at risk, particularly because research is still ongoing into how much vaccines protect not only against disease but also against infection and transmission.</li>
                <h2>How coronavirus treated</h2>
                <li>More severe cases may require hospital care, where a patient may receive a combination of treatments that could include steroids, oxygen, mechanical breathing support and other COVID-19 treatments in development. Infusions of monoclonal antibodies given to certain patients early in the infection may reduce the symptoms, severity and duration of the illness
                </li>

                <li>Citizen can choose the vaccination centre as per their choice of vaccine being administered However, the choice will not be available at the Government facilities</li>

                <li>There are four types of vaccines in clinical trials: whole virus, protein subunit, viral vector and nucleic acid (RNA and DNA), each of which protects people, but by producing immunity in a slightly different way.</li>
                <h2>Effects</h2>
                <li>As the coronavirus pandemic rapidly sweeps across the world, it is inducing a considerable degree of fear, worry and concern in the population at large and among certain groups in particular, such as older adults, care providers and people with underlying health conditions.</li>
